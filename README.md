# HTML/CSS Capstone

For our HTML/CSS capstone, you are going to replicate [this page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/) using bootstrap! Do not inspect the page with Chrome dev tools unless you're feeling really stuck

You will notice that this site has some interactivity. See if you can figure out which [component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) does this out of the box.

You should be able to replicate the original site pretty exactly, given that it is built in Bootstrap itself. You will need to do some minor modifications, however. The starter project already links in a `styles.css` file for these customization.

I encourage you to copy and paste code from Bootstrap's docs liberally!
